    "* As far as I know this competition have very unreliable LB, because soundscapes are from sources the model have never seen, so ~0.01 could be just the randomness of data (my exact same model with different random seed can have score diff of 0.03). However, using sigmoid rather than softmax pretty much always gave me a higher score for my codes. For me tuning up mixup helped because, like you said, it's a multi label problem but the training data are mostly single label.\n",
